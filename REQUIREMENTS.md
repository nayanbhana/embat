### Create a Micro Batcher
Micro-batching is a technique used in processing pipelines where individual tasks are grouped
together into small batches. This can improve throughput by reducing the number of requests made
to a downstream system. Your task is to implement a micro-batching library, with the following
requirements:

- it should allow the caller to submit a single Job, and it should return a JobResult
- it should process accepted Jobs in batches using a BatchProcessor
    ○   Don't implement BatchProcessor. This should be a dependency of your library.
- it should provide a way to configure the batching behaviour i.e. size and frequency
- it should expose a shutdown method which returns after all previously accepted Jobs are
processed

**We will be looking for:**
- a well designed API
- usability as an external library
- good documentation/comments
- a well written, maintainable test suite
